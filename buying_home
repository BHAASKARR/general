Buying home checklist:
      1. Are you debt free?
      2. Do you have emergency fund?
      3. Down payment on a 15 year fixed rate?
         where payments are no more than 1/4 of your take-home pay?

     4. Pay 20% down payment to avoid PMI - private mortagage insurance
     5. Due to having the lowest total cost, we recommend a 15-year fixed rate mortgage with at least 10% down payment (ideally, 20% to avoid PMI)
     
Down-payment : 10-20 % atleast
Closing fees: 3-4 %
      Taxes : 1 %

Emergency fund : 5K to 10k
